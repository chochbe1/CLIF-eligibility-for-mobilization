# Eligibility for Mobilization

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to determine the windows of opportunity for safely mobilizing patients on ventilators within the first 72 hours of first intubation, during business hours (8am-5pm). The analysis is guided by three established criteria sets, *Patel et al.*, and  *TEAM Study*, as well as a consensus criteria approach, which includes Green, Yellow, and Red safety flags.


## Required CLIF tables and fields

The following tables are required:
1. **patient**: `patient_id`, `race_category`, `ethnicity_category`, `sex_category`, `death_dttm`
2. **hospitalization**: `patient_id`, `hospitalization_id`, `admission_dttm`, `discharge_dttm`, `age_at_admission`
3. **vitals**: `hospitalization_id`, `recorded_dttm`, `vital_category`, `vital_value`
   - `vital_category` = 'heart_rate', 'resp_rate', 'sbp', 'dbp', 'map', 'resp_rate', 'spo2', ''weight_kg', 'height_cm'
4. **labs**: `hospitalization_id`, `lab_result_dttm`, `lab_category`, `lab_value`
   - `lab_category` = 'lactate', 'creatinine', 'bilirubin_total', 'po2_arterial', 'platelet_count'
5. **medication_admin_continuous**: `hospitalization_id`, `admin_dttm`, `med_name`, `med_category`, `med_dose`, `med_dose_unit`
   - `med_category` = "norepinephrine", "epinephrine", "phenylephrine", "vasopressin", "dopamine", "angiotensin", "nicardipine", "nitroprusside", "clevidipine", "cisatracurium", "vecuronium", "rocuronium"
6. **respiratory_support**: `hospitalization_id`, `recorded_dttm`, `device_category`, `mode_category`, `tracheostomy`, `fio2_set`, `lpm_set`, `resp_rate_set`, `peep_set`, `resp_rate_obs`
7. crrt_therapy: `hospitalization_id`, `recorded_dttm`

## Cohort Identification 

The study period is from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2022. The cohort consists of patients who were placed on invasive ventilation at any point during their hospitalization within this time period. Encounters that were intubated for less than 4 hours were excluded. Additionally, encounters that received tracheostomy or were receiving any paralytic drug were considered ineligible to be mobilised for that hour.

## Configuration

1. Navigate to the `config/` directory.
2. Rename `config_template.json` to `config.json`.
3. Update the `config.json` with site-specific settings.


## Environment setup and project execution

The environment setup code is provided in the `setup.sh` file for macOS and `setup.bat` for Windows.

**For macOS:**

1. Make the script executable: 
```bash
chmod +x run_project.sh
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
./run_project.sh
```

3. Restart your IDE to load the new virtual environment and select the `Python (mobilization)` kernel in the Jupyter notebook.

**For Windows:**

1. Run the script in the command prompt:
```bat
run_project.bat
```
